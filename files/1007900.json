Doesn't it?\nAnd if you do find someone better\nI'll still see you in everything\nFor always, tomorrow, and all the time\nDon't you like me for me?\nIs there any better feeling than coming clean?\nAnd I know myself and I'll never love anyone else\nI won't love anyone else\nI'll never love anyone else\nIf it's not supposed to be\nThen I'll just let it be\nAnd out of everyone\nBe honest with me\nWho do you change for?\nWho's top of your world?\nAnd out of everyone\nWho's your type of girl?\nAnd we can be anything\nEven apart\nAnd out of everything\nIt doesn't have to be this hard\nI could be anyone but I'm so entwined\nAnd out of everyone\nWho's on your mind?\nNo more changes\nI'll still love you the same",
