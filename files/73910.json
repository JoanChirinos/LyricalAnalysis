      "lyrics": "My lover's got humour\nShe's the giggle at a funeral\nKnows everybody's disapproval\nI should've worshipped her sooner\nIf the heavens ever did speak\nShe's the last true mouthpiece\nEvery Sunday's gettin' more bleak\nA fresh poison each week\nWe were born sick, you heard them say it\nMy church offers no absolutes\nShe tells me, \"Worship in the bedroom\"\nThe only heaven I'll be sent to\nIs when I'm alone with you\nI was born sick, but I love it\nCommand me to be well\nA, amen\nAmen, amen\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nIf I'm a pagan of the good times\nMy lover's the sunlight\nTo keep the goddess on my side\nShe demands a sacrifice\nDrain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny\nSomethin' meaty for the main course\nThat's a fine lookin' high horse\nWhat you got in the stable?\nWe've a lot of starvin' faithful\nThat looks tasty, that looks plenty\nThis is hungry work\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nNo masters or kings when the ritual begins\nThere is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin\nIn the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene\nOnly then, I am human, only then, I am clean\nOh, oh, amen\nAmen, amen\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life",

      "lyrics": "Without shame, two outfits then to my name\nYou'd end up in one when you'd stay\nWe had nowhere to go and every desire for goin' there\nI heard once, it's the comforts that make us feel numb\nWe'd go out with no way to get home\nAnd we'd sleep on somebody's floor and wake up feelin' like a millionaire\nWish I'd known it was just our turn (We just got by)\nBeing blamed for a world we had no power in (But we tried)\nYou and I had nothin' to show (We didn't know)\nBut the best of the world in the palm of our hands (Anythin', darlin')\nAnd darlin', I haven't felt it since then\nI don't know how the feelin' ended\nBut I know bein' reckless and young\nIs not how the damage gets done\nOne time we would want for nothin' (One time, we had it all, love)\nWe knew what our love was worth (When we had nothin')\nNow we're always missin' somethin' (I miss when)\nI miss when we did not need much\nOh, if the car ran, the car was enough\nIf the sun shone on us, it's a plus\nAnd the tank was always filled up\nOnly enough for our gettin' there\nThat first car was like wings on an angel (You flew away)l\nBefore the whole wide world got too thin (From me then)\nI swear goodwill kept up the engine\nYou were steerin' my heart like a wheel in your hands (Turn back, darling)\nAnd darlin', I haven't felt it since then\nI don't know how the feelin' ended\nBut I know bein' reckless and young\nIs not how the damage gets done\nAll I needed was someone\nWhen the whole wide world felt young\nAll I needed was someone\nWhen the whole wide world felt young"

      "lyrics": "As a child, it was the place names\nSingin' at me as the first thing\nHow the mouth must be employed\nin every corner of itself\nTo say, \"Appalacicola\n\" or, \"Hushpuckena,\"\nlike, \"Gweebarra\n\"\nA promise softly sung of somewhere else\nAnd as a young man blessed to pass so many road signs\nAnd have my foreign ear made fresh again on each unlikely sound\nBut feel at home, hearin' a music that few still understand\nA butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground\nThe ears were chopped from young men if the pitch cap didn't kill them\nThey are buried without scalp in the shattered bedrock of our home\nYou may never know your fortune\nUntil the distance has been shown between what is lost forever\nAnd what can still be known\nSo far from home to have a stranger call you \"darling\"\nAnd have your guarded heart be lifted like a child up by the hand\nIn some town that just means \"home\" to them\nWith no translator left to sound\nA butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground"
