Oh\nEvery minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nEvery stumble and each misfire\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nWatching through my fingers\nWatching through my fingers\nCaught off guard by your favourite song\nOh I'll be dancing at a funeral\nDancing at a funeral\nSleeping in the clothes you love\nIt's such a shame we had to see them burn\nShame we had to see them burn\nWhat's gonna be left of the world if you're not in it?\nWhat's gonna be left of the world, oh\nEvery minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nEvery stumble and each misfire\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nIf you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle\nNow stop worrying and go get dressed\nYou might have to excuse me\nI've lost control of all my senses\nAnd you might have to excuse me\nI've lost control of all my words\nSo get drunk, call me a fool\nPut me in my place, put me in my place\nPick me up, up off the floor\nPut me in my place, put me in my place\nEvery minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nEvery stumble and each misfire\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nWatching through my fingers\nWatching through my fingers\nCause every minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more",

Won't you exorcise my mind?\nI want to be free as I'll ever be\nExorcise my mind, help me exorcise my mind\nDesdemona, won't you liberate me?\nWhen I'm haunted by your ancient history\nClose these green eyes and watch over as I sleep\nThrough my darkest of dreams\nBe the power to compel me\nHold me closer than anyone before\nSet me free from my jealousy\nWon't you exorcise my mind? Won't you exorcise my mind?\nI want to be free as I'll ever be\nExorcise my mind, help me exorcise my mind\nI should be thinking 'bout nothing else when I'm with you, with you, oh-oh-oh\nI should be thinking 'bout nothing else when I'm with you, with you, oh-oh-oh\n\"Your mind exists somewhere altogether different; it lives in a world where feelings simply cannot be defined by words\"\nSet me free from my jealousy\nWon't you exorcise my mind?

Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nSummer evening, breezes blew, drawing voices deep from you\nLead by your beating heart\nWhat a year and what a night, what terrifying final sights\nPut out your beating heart\nThe night was all you had\nYou ran into the night from all you had\nFound yourself a path up on the ground\nYou ran into the night; you can't be found\nBut, this is your heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nIf you had your gun\nWould you shoot it at the sky?\nWhy--to see where it would fall\nOr will you come down at all?\nIf you had your gun\nWould you shoot it at the sky?\nWhy--to see where your bullet would fall\nOr will you come down at all?\nThis is your heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nThis is your racing heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it?

We sink or swim\n(We're riding the wave)\nOh, what would your mother say if she could see what we're doing now?\nOh, what would your mother say if she could hear what we talk about? (Hey)\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me again, again, again\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me\nI'll see you on the other side\nGet carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught up in, caught up in the waves\nThe air hit me on the way out\nDid it make me more sober or make me more drunk?\nI couldn't quite remember the vision of you and of me\nThe air hit me on the way out\nDid it make me more sober or make me more drunk?\nI couldn't quite remember the vision of you and of me\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me again, again, again\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me\nI'll see you on the other side\nGet carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught up in, caught up in the waves\nThey're crashing down, they're crashing down, oh\n(The waves)\nThey're crashing down on you and me\nI'll see you on the other side\n(We're riding the wave)",
