    "# An Analysis of Lyrical Diversity in Some Groups of Music Artists\n",
    "### by Joan Chirinos\n",

    "We will be ananlyzing the diversity of lyrics, defined by how many different words an artist uses compared to how many total words that artist uses in their body of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing on a couple of different groups:\n",
    "* top artists\n",
    "* some of my favorite artists\n",
    "* some of Siena Larrick's favorite artists\n",
    "* a spread of pop artists from those with the lowest lyrical diversity to those with the highest lyrical diversity\n",
    "* a spread of all artists, from those with the lowest lyrical diversity to those with the highest lyrical diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last group stated, we will be doing an analysis of which musical genre, if any, is generally most lyrically diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the Genius API to find song data, and we're going to use Selenium to scrape the lyrics off of the Genius webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to use the Last.FM API to find top artists in an easy an managable way, as they sort artists by tags and keep track of tags and whatnot."
